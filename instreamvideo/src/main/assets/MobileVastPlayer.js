Normalizing means that a relative\n     * URL will be resolved into an absolute URL in the context of the application document.\n     * Parsing means that the anchor node's host, hostname, protocol, port, pathname and related\n     * properties are all populated to reflect the normalized URL.  This approach has wide\n     * compatibility - Safari 1+, Mozilla 1+, Opera 7+,e etc.  See\n     * http://www.aptana.com/reference/html/api/HTMLAnchorElement.html\n     *\n     * Implementation Notes for IE\n     * ---------------------------\n     * IE >= 8 and <= 10 normalizes the URL when assigned to the anchor node similar to the other\n     * browsers.  However, the parsed components will not be set if the URL assigned did not specify\n     * them.  (e.g. if you assign a.href = \"foo\", then a.protocol, a.host, etc. will be empty.)  We\n     * work around that by performing the parsing in a 2nd step by taking a previously normalized\n     * URL (e.g. by assigning to a.href) and assigning it a.href again.  This correctly populates the\n     * properties such as protocol, hostname, port, etc.\n     *\n     * IE7 does not normalize the URL when assigned to an anchor node.  (Apparently, it does, if one\n     * uses the inner HTML approach to assign the URL as part of an HTML snippet -\n     * http://stackoverflow.com/a/472729)  However, setting img[src] does normalize the URL.\n     * Unfortunately, setting img[src] to something like \"javascript:foo\" on IE throws an exception.\n     * Since the primary usage for normalizing URLs is to sanitize such URLs, we can't use that\n     * method and IE < 8 is unsupported.\n     *\n     * References:\n     *   http://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLAnchorElement\n     *   http://www.aptana.com/reference/html/api/HTMLAnchorElement.html\n     *   http://url.spec.whatwg.org/#urlutils\n     *   https://github.com/angular/angular.js/pull/2902\n     *   http://james.padolsey.com/javascript/parsing-urls-with-the-dom/\n     *\n     * @kind function\n     * @param {string} url The URL to be parsed.\n     * @description Normalizes and parses a URL.\n     * @returns {object} Returns the normalized URL as a dictionary.\n     *\n     *   | member name   | Description    |\n     *   |---------------|----------------|\n     *   | href          | A normalized version of the provided URL if it was not an absolute URL |\n     *   | protocol      | The protocol including the trailing colon                              |\n     *   | host          | The host and port (if the port is non-default) of the normalizedUrl    |\n     *   | search        | The search params, minus the question mark                             |\n     *   | hash          | The hash string, minus the hash symbol\n     *   | hostname      | The hostname\n     *   | port          | The port, without \":\"\n     *   | pathname      | The pathname, beginning with \"/\"\n     *\n     */\n\n    var urlParsingNode = document.createElement(\"a\");\n\n    function urlParts(url) {\n        var href = url;\n\n        if (msie) {\n            // Normalize before parse.
