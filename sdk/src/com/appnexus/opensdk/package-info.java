 * This SDK gives you the application developer the ability to do so. 
 * There are two general kinds of advertisments, banners and interstitials. 
 * Banners are ads that occupy some part of the screen you choose and within whichever views you choose.  
 * Interstitials are ads that take the whole screen they are modal, they typically generate larger revenue
 * and are used for example between game levels, or when the application starts, it is your choice to decide where ad's will be visible.
